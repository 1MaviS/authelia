2023 The Linux Foundation <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage>

Certain marks of The Linux Foundation have been created to enable you to communicate compatibility or interoperability
of software or products. In addition to the requirement that any use of a mark to make an assertion of compatibility
must, of course, be accurate, the use of these marks must avoid confusion regarding The Linux Foundationâ€™s association
with the product. The use of the mark cannot imply that The Linux Foundation or its projects are sponsoring or
endorsing the product.
